# Tree type (e.g. oak), log, leaf, and grow_method all correspond to enums. They're case insensitive, which is
# demonstrated in this config.
#
# Tree types:
# - OAK
# - SPRUCE
# - BIRCH
# - JUNGLE
# - ACACIA
# - DARK_OAK
# - CRIMSON
# - WARPED
#
# Grow methods:
# - BONEMEAL
# - NATURAL
# - BOTH
#
# Chance isn't a percentage, think of it as a fraction. For example, you could have two trees, with 2 chances, 50, and
# 100. The percentage of these chances can be figured out by dividing the chance by the total probability of all relevant
# tree configurations (i.e. same tree type, and same grow method).
# 100 / 150 = 2/3 = 66.6%
# 50 / 150 = 1/3 = 33.3%
#
# If no tree configuration is present for a particular type & grow method, the default tree will be generated.
